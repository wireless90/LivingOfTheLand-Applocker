# LivingOfTheLand-Applocker
Preventing LOTL attacks using Applocker

# Introduction

Living off the Land (LOTL) refers to attackers using either operating system features or binaries to fly under the radar when performing sophisticated attacks. A legitimate tool is less likely to raise suspicions and less likely to trigger an antivirus detection. With attackers and employees using the same tools and processes, malicious activity becomes a needle in the haystack, hidden among the vast and growing legitimate activity on the victimâ€™s network.

This article focuses at some LOTL Binaries (LOLBins) whose function enables an attacker to execute his Scripts/executables, by passing AppLocker's default rules. We will also then look at Applocker rules that will mitigate them.

# Applocker Default Rules

The Applocker by default only allows scripts/executables to be ran in the `Program Files` or `Windows` folder.

# MSHTA.EXE

Used by Windows to execute html applications. (.hta)

We can execute `javascripts` or `vbs` by masking them under `.hta` files.

Below we have a javascript file that opens up a calc.exe

```js
<script LANGUAGE="JScript">
  new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell").run("calc.exe");
</script> 
```

If we were to double click it or open it using `wscript` or `cscript`, Applocker blocks it.

This is because the script is not in the `Program Files` or `Windows` folder.

If we were to rename the extension to `.hta`, windows uses `mshta.exe` to open it which is allowed by Applocker as it is in `C:\Windows\System32\`, which is a subdirectory of the `windows` folder.
